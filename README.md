# employee-directory

## Description 

This project is a web app that will allow the user to keep view an employee directory. In this directory, the user can sort by the names of the employees alphabetically. They can also search for names or letters and the page will automatically update, as it is a single page application.

## Installation
This app can be accessed [here](http://patrickhannan.github.io/employee-directory).

However, if the user wants to locally host the app, they must download the files from this repository. Those can be accessed [here](https://github.com/patrickhannan/employee-directory).

Once the user downloads these files, they must open the files in VS Code. In VS Code, the user will run a new terminal. In the terminal, the user will change their working directory to the current directory. 

Run "npm install" to install the app.


## Usage 
*If the user uses the app locally, run the command npm start in the terminal, then localhost:3000 will be opened in a web browser.* 

Once in the app, the user will see a table with the headings id, name, email, and phone number for each employee. To sort by name, click on the name heading. To search, enter the desired search in the search bar and the page will update accordingly.

Below is a image of how the app will look.
